# Homework LaTeX Template

A simple, single-file LaTeX template for my assignments.

## Features

- **Single-File**: Everything you need is contained within a single LaTeX file, making it easy to manage and share.
- **No Dependencies**: The template does not rely on external packages or libraries, ensuring compatibility and simplicity.
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt the template to fit your specific needs or preferences.

## Getting Started

To use this LaTeX template, you'll need to have a LaTeX distribution installed. Some popular options include:

- [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)
- [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/)
- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) (for an online LaTeX editor)

### Example: Using on Overleaf (Recommended)

- Step 1. Create an Overleaf project or open an existing project.
- Step 2. Upload (or Copy-Paste, since the template is just a single file) `template.tex` to the project folder.
- Step 3. Click "Menu - Settings", make sure:
  - Compiler: `pdfLaTeX`
  - Main document: `template.tex`

  And then just compile and use it!

Note that by changing the "Main document" option, We can place several weeks' worth of assignments under the same Overleaf project. And with the online editor Overleaf, we can work on our assignments from different devices without the need to configure local LaTeX environment (just using your browser!).
